/**
 * CallbackClient is a simple client that supports unary and server
 * streaming methods. Methods take callback functions, which will be
 * called when a response message arrives, or an error occurs.
 *
 * Client methods return a function that cancels the call. This is a
 * convenient alternative to creating a AbortController and passing
 * its AbortSignal as an option to the method.
 *
 * If a call is cancelled by an AbortController or by the returned
 * cancel-function, ConnectErrors with the code Canceled are
 * silently discarded.
 *
 * CallbackClient is most convenient for use in React effects, where
 * a function returned by the effect is called when the effect is
 * torn down.
